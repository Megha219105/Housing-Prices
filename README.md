# Housing-Prices

This repository is to predict the house prices using the building, location and space characteristics of a house. The data is taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)

With the given data, I have tried to explore the data and model it using python libraries. For data exploration I have used NumPy and Pandas. EDA is an important part of any data model fitting and in this repo I have tried to build procedural steps for EDA.
